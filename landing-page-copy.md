## FAQ Section

### How does zero-knowledge encryption work?
Zero-knowledge means SafeNode cannot access your passwords. Your master password encrypts your data locally, and only you can decrypt it. We never see your master password or unencrypted data.

### What happens if I forget my master password?
Unfortunately, we cannot recover your master password due to our zero-knowledge architecture. However, you can set up account recovery options during setup, including biometric authentication and recovery codes.

### Is my data stored securely?
Yes. All data is encrypted with AES-256 before leaving your device. Your encrypted vault is stored on secure servers with multiple layers of protection, including regular security audits.

### Can I use SafeNode offline?
Yes. Your vault is stored locally on your device, so you can access your passwords even without an internet connection. Changes will sync when you reconnect.

### How does breach monitoring work?
SafeNode continuously monitors data breach databases and dark web marketplaces. When we detect your email or passwords in a breach, you'll receive an immediate alert with recommendations.

### Can I import passwords from other managers?
Yes. SafeNode supports importing from most major password managers, including LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, and Chrome's built-in manager.
