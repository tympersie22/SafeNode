4. **Verify your email** (check your inbox for a verification link)

## 2. Master Password

### What is a Master Password?

Your **master password** is the key to your encrypted vault. It:
- Never leaves your device (zero-knowledge encryption)
- Is required to unlock your vault
- Should be strong and unique

### Creating a Strong Master Password

**Do:**
- ✅ Use at least 16 characters
- ✅ Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- ✅ Use a passphrase: `Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple-2024!`
- ✅ Store it securely offline (password manager backup)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use personal information (name, birthday, pet name)
- ❌ Reuse passwords from other accounts
- ❌ Write it down in an insecure place

### Unlocking Your Vault

Each time you access SafeNode, you'll need to:
1. Enter your master password
2. Or use biometric unlock (if enabled)
3. Or use your PIN (if set up)

**Note**: If you forget your master password, **we cannot recover it**. Your vault is encrypted with zero-knowledge, meaning we have no way to decrypt your data.
