## 1. Landing Page Hero

A clean, modern hero section with a gradient background transitioning from light purple (#faf5ff) at the top to white at the bottom. Centered in the frame is a large, bold headline in dark gray (#1e293b) reading "Your passwords, encrypted. Your privacy, protected." Below it, a subheadline in medium gray (#64748b) explains SafeNode's value proposition. Two prominent call-to-action buttons sit side-by-side: the primary button features a vibrant purple-to-pink gradient (#9333ea to #ec4899) with white text reading "Start Secure Vault," while the secondary button is outlined in purple with purple text reading "Try Free." To the right of the text, a sleek illustration shows a stylized vault door with a purple gradient, partially open with light rays emanating from within, symbolizing security and accessibility. The entire composition uses generous white space, rounded corners (16px radius), and subtle shadows. The layout is responsive, with the illustration positioned on desktop but stacking below on mobile. Trust indicators appear as small icons below the CTAs: a lock icon, a shield icon, and text reading "50,000+ users trust SafeNode."

## 2. Dashboard Overview

A spacious dashboard interface with a light gray background (#f8fafc) and a white main content area. At the top, a clean navigation bar features the SafeNode logo on the left in purple, with navigation items (Vault, Breach Scan, Settings) in the center, and a user profile avatar on the right. Below the nav, a welcome message appears: "Welcome back, Sarah" in large, bold text. The main dashboard displays a grid of cards with rounded corners (16px) and subtle shadows. The first card shows "Total Passwords" with a large number (247) in brand purple, accompanied by a lock icon. The second card displays "Breach Alerts" with a green checkmark and "All Secure" message. The third card shows "Last Sync" with a timestamp and cloud sync icon. A search bar sits prominently at the top with a magnifying glass icon, using a light background and rounded corners. Below, a table or list view shows recent password entries with icons, titles, and last modified dates. Each row has a hover state indicated by a light purple background. The overall design is minimalistic, using the SafeNode color palette with purple accents, clean typography (Inter font), and plenty of breathing room between elements.

## 3. Vault Entries List

A clean, organized list view of password entries displayed in a white card with rounded corners (16px) and a subtle shadow. The header section contains a search input field with a magnifying glass icon on the left, placeholder text "Search passwords...", and a filter button on the right. Below, a horizontal tab bar shows categories: "All" (active, highlighted in purple), "Favorites," "Recently Used," and "Tags." The main list area displays password entries in a card-based layout. Each entry card shows a colored icon or logo on the left (circular, 40px), the service name in bold dark text (e.g., "GitHub"), the username or email below in lighter gray, and a three-dot menu icon on the right. Some entries have a star icon indicating favorites, and others show a warning badge for weak passwords. The cards are separated by subtle gray dividers and have a hover effect that slightly elevates them with a shadow. At the bottom right, a floating action button with a purple gradient and a plus icon allows adding new entries. The background is light gray (#f8fafc), and the overall aesthetic is clean and minimalistic, similar to Linear or Notion's design language.

## 4. Vault Entry Detail Page

A detailed view of a single password entry displayed in a centered modal or full-page layout with a white background. At the top, a back arrow and the service name "GitHub" in large, bold text. Below, a circular service icon (80px) with the GitHub logo, centered. The main content area is organized in sections with clear labels. The "Username" field shows the email address in a readable font with a copy icon button on the right. The "Password" field displays masked dots (••••••••) with an eye icon to toggle visibility, and a copy button. A "Password Strength" indicator shows a green progress bar labeled "Strong" with a checkmark. Additional fields include "Website URL" with a clickable link icon, "Notes" section with placeholder text, and "Tags" displayed as small purple badges. At the bottom, action buttons are arranged horizontally: "Edit" (outlined purple), "Share" (outlined gray), and "Delete" (red text). The layout uses consistent spacing (16px padding), rounded input fields (12px radius), and the SafeNode purple accent color for interactive elements. The design is clean and focused, with clear visual hierarchy and ample white space.

## 5. Unlock Vault Animation Concept

A centered, focused view of the vault unlock interface. The background is a dark gradient transitioning from deep purple (#3b0764) at the top to dark slate (#0f172a) at the bottom, creating a secure, premium feel. In the center, a large circular vault door illustration (200px diameter) with a purple gradient border and a keyhole in the middle. The keyhole glows with a soft purple light, pulsing gently. Below the vault, a password input field with rounded corners (12px) and a dark background, showing placeholder text "Enter master password" in light gray. The input has a purple focus ring when active. Above the vault, the SafeNode logo appears in white, and below the password field, text reads "Unlocking your secure vault..." in light gray. The animation concept shows the vault door rotating slightly and opening with light rays emanating from within, transitioning from locked (closed, dark) to unlocked (open, glowing). The overall aesthetic is premium and secure, using the SafeNode brand colors with smooth animations and a focus on the central unlock action.

## 6. Breach Scan Animation Concept

A dynamic, security-focused interface showing the breach scanning process. The background is white with a subtle gray gradient. At the top, a header reads "Breach Scan" in bold, dark text with a shield icon. The main content area features a large circular progress indicator (200px) in the center, showing a purple gradient ring that animates clockwise as the scan progresses. Inside the circle, a shield icon with a checkmark appears when complete, or a scanning animation (rotating dots) during the process. Below the progress circle, status text updates dynamically: "Scanning 1,247 passwords..." transitioning to "Scan complete! All secure." The scan results are displayed in cards below: "Email addresses checked: 3" with a green checkmark, "Passwords monitored: 1,247" with a green checkmark, and "Breaches found: 0" with a green checkmark and shield icon. The animation shows the progress ring filling from 0% to 100%, with smooth transitions and the shield icon appearing with a scale-in animation when complete. The color scheme uses SafeNode purple for active states, green for success, and clean white/gray backgrounds. The design is informative yet reassuring, emphasizing security and protection.

## 7. Mobile App Home Screen

An iOS/Android mobile app home screen with a clean, modern design. The status bar at the top shows the time, battery, and signal indicators. Below, a navigation bar features the SafeNode logo (purple) on the left and a settings icon on the right. The main content area has a light background (#f8fafc) with a welcome message: "Good morning, Sarah" in large, bold text at the top. A search bar with rounded corners (12px) and a magnifying glass icon sits below, with placeholder text "Search your vault." The primary content displays a grid of quick access cards: a large card showing "Total Passwords: 247" with a purple gradient background and lock icon, a card for "Breach Alerts" showing "All Secure" with a green checkmark, and a card for "Recent" showing the last three accessed passwords with icons and names. Each card has rounded corners (16px), subtle shadows, and uses the SafeNode color palette. At the bottom, a tab bar navigation shows icons for "Vault" (active, purple), "Scan," "Add," and "Settings." The overall design is clean and minimalistic, optimized for mobile with touch-friendly targets (44px minimum) and the SafeNode brand colors throughout.

## 8. Mobile App Unlock Vault

A focused, secure mobile unlock screen with a dark gradient background transitioning from deep purple (#3b0764) to black. The SafeNode logo appears at the top center in white, scaled appropriately for mobile. Below, a large circular vault illustration (150px diameter) with a purple gradient border and glowing keyhole in the center. The vault has a subtle pulsing animation. Below the vault, a password input field with a dark background, rounded corners (12px), and light gray placeholder text "Master password." The input shows masked dots when typing, with a biometric authentication option (fingerprint icon) appearing below for supported devices. A "Unlock" button sits at the bottom with a purple gradient background, white text, and rounded corners (12px). The button has a subtle glow effect. Below the unlock button, a "Forgot password?" link appears in light gray. The overall design is premium and secure, with the vault as the central focus, smooth animations, and the SafeNode brand colors. The layout is optimized for one-handed use, with the unlock button positioned within thumb reach.

## 9. Mobile App Settings

A mobile settings screen with a clean, organized layout. The header shows "Settings" in large, bold text with a back arrow on the left. The main content area has a white background with sections separated by subtle dividers. The first section shows the user profile with a circular avatar (60px) in purple, the user's name "Sarah Chen" in bold, and email below in gray. Below, settings sections are organized in groups: "Account" section with options like "Change Master Password," "Two-Factor Authentication" (with a toggle switch), and "Account Recovery." Each option has an icon on the left (purple), the label in dark text, and a chevron or toggle on the right. The "Security" section includes "Breach Monitoring" (enabled, green), "Auto-Lock" with a time selector, and "Biometric Authentication" (enabled). The "Appearance" section has "Theme" with options for Light/Dark/System, and "Language" settings. The "About" section shows the app version and links to privacy policy and terms. At the bottom, a red "Sign Out" button with rounded corners. The design uses consistent spacing (16px padding), rounded corners (12px for inputs, 16px for cards), and the SafeNode purple accent for interactive elements. The overall aesthetic is clean and organized, similar to iOS Settings but with SafeNode branding.
