# SafeNode Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16px icon for extension toolbar
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32px icon for Windows
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48px icon for extension management
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128px icon for Chrome Web Store

## Icon Design

The SafeNode icon should be:
- **Lock symbol** with gradient background (purple to pink)
- **Simple and recognizable** at small sizes
- **Consistent** with the main app branding

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders. The extension will work without proper icons, but they should be added for production.

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- **Design tools**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe Illustrator
- **Online generators**: favicon.io, realfavicongenerator.net
- **Simple tools**: Canva, GIMP

Make sure to maintain the same design across all sizes while ensuring they're readable at 16x16px.
